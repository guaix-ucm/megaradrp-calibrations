# MR-VR Nico's version
# ThI wavelengths have been extrated from:
# http://iraf.noao.edu/specatlas/thar_photron/thar_photron.html
# (Ar lines from that list have been removed).
# Ne wavelengths were initially identified in:
# http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/reference-spectra
# http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/sites/default/files/instruments/spectrographs/hydne.dat
# but then they were refined using:
# http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Column #1: wavelength
#Column #2: flag (1: bright enough subsample; 0: faint subsample)
#Column #3: relative intensity (NIST)
#Column #4: comment (after '#' symbol)
